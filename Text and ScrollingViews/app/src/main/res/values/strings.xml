    <string name="article_text">In a vault deep inside Abbey Road Studios in London protected by an unmarked
        triple-locked, police-alarmed door-are something like 400 hours of unreleased
        Beatles recordings, starting from June 2, 1962 and ending with the very last
        tracks recorded for the <i>Let It Be</i> album. The best of the best were
        released by Apple Records in the form of the 3-volume Anthology series. For
        more information, see the Beatles Time Capsule at <b>www.rockument.com</b>\n\nThis
        volume starts with the first new Beatle song, \"Free as a Bird\" (based on a John Lenenon
        demo, found only on <i>The Lost Lennon Tapes Vol. 28,</i> and covers the very earliest
        historical recordings, outtakes from the first albums, and live recordings from
        early concerts and BBC Radio sessions.\n\n<b>Highlights include:</b>\n\n<b><i>Cry for
        a Shadow -</i></b> Many a Beatle fanatic started down the outtake road, like I did,

        single session that yielded four songs (the three featured Tony Sheridan with the
        Beatles as backing band), \"Cry for a Shadow\" is a n instrumental written by Lennon
        and Harrison, which makes it Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit,
